Hi, my name is Xiangyu Li, a computer Graphics researcher and engineer. I received my master’s degree from Brown University and my bachelor’s degree from Southeast University. I am now a game engine developer at miHoYo.

I am interested in Graphics, Vision, Machine Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction. My dream is to make it easy for everyone to bring their dream world to reality. So my research is mainly about taking knowledge of machine learning to help people do graphics work. It could be a very wide range and I am now focusing on exploring the application of deep learning in rendering and content generation.

My previous experience involves a wide field of study. From rendering (both Monte-Carlo-based and rasterization-based) to simulation, from free-hand interactions in smartphone AR to object 6D pose estimation from a single RGB(D) image. I think those are all important for me to figure out what is important and necessary to bring imagination world to reality.
